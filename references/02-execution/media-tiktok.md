# TikTok Pixel browser tags

## Complete the media brief

Confirm or derive:

- TikTok Pixel ID, Ads account, and environment;
- requested business action and optimization/reporting/audience use;
- current standard event or justified custom event;
- catalog/product-ID convention and shopping objective;
- required value, currency, content fields, order ID, and item arrays;
- Event Builder, automatic events, or existing partner integration;
- automatic/manual Advanced Matching request;
- CMP and strict/basic consent policy or explicitly requested TikTok Pixel cookie-consent behavior.

## Research current TikTok events and parameters

Open the current official TikTok standard-events page, parameter reference, custom-event rules, GTM event-tag guide, and installed template documentation. Extract:

- exact standard event code and meaning;
- recommended, required, and conditionally required parameters for the selected objective;
- accepted type, enum, currency, array, and object shape;
- reserved custom-event names and naming limits;
- Pixel base/event dependency and template fields;
- catalog/ROAS/Video Shopping requirements;
- current cookie, consent, and Advanced Matching behavior.

Do not rely on a static list in this skill. TikTok revises its events and parameters.

## Design the Pixel object graph

Use a verified `CST - TikTok pixel_id` when appropriate. Ensure one compatible Pixel initialization path exists, reusing a compatible GTM base tag, site code, partner integration, or template behavior. Create a new GTM base tag only when initialization is in scope and no compatible path exists. Configure requested event tags separately and use the vendor-neutral Custom Event trigger; TikTok's current GTM guidance also recommends a GTM custom event for event tags.

Do not make the base tag send a page-view event by default. Configure a separate official page-view event only when requested and after inspecting Event Builder, automatic event detection, partner/CMS integrations, existing Pixel code, and automatic SPA behavior. If the current official base code or selected template inherently sends a page view, document that vendor exception and prevent a duplicate separate or history-based page view.

## Map commerce and content fields exactly

Treat `content_id`, `content_ids`, `contents`, `content_type`, value, currency, and order fields as separate contracts. Verify the current page because requirements can vary by objective.

When the current schema requires arrays:

- preserve every eligible product ID;
- return the documented array/object structure even for one item;
- map the catalog's actual SKU or item-group convention;
- preserve exact types and allowed enums;
- test empty, one-item, and multi-item cases.

Do not assume Meta's field shapes are valid for TikTok merely because some parameter names are similar.

## Avoid Event Builder and manual duplicates

Inspect TikTok Events Manager, Event Builder rules, Enhanced Data Postback/automatic features, partner installations, and existing GTM tags. Choose one browser collection source for the action. If an automatic rule and a proposed manual event overlap, do not add the manual event until the media owner selects the intended source and any removal or disablement of the overlap is separately authorized. Browser/server deduplication remains deferred.

## Configure Advanced Matching only explicitly

Do not enable automatic or manual Advanced Matching by default. Require explicit approval, verify accepted identifiers, source, normalization, hashing, automatic field scanning, and data-sharing terms from current official documentation. Follow the first-party-data reference.

## Apply consent

Use strict/basic CMP gating by default for the Pixel base and all event tags. Attach `Block - <CMP> - TikTok denied` and prove no Pixel script/request loads for unknown or denied consent.

TikTok documents a Pixel cookie-consent mode and cookie enable/disable controls. Classify that first as `native cookie-control`, not automatically as advanced denied-state measurement. Cookie suppression does not prove which events, fields, identifiers, or requests continue, nor that TikTok applies an advertiser-specific model.

Use a TikTok-native limited-data route only when explicitly requested and current official product/template documentation establishes the complete denied-state request, storage, data-use, and revocation behavior approved by the client. Otherwise retain the strict/basic block. Do not assume that enabling Google Consent Mode alone gates or changes a third-party TikTok template.
