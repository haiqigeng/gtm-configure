## Scope

Use this generic route for an approved client-side analytics requirement whose destination is not
Google tag/GA4. GA4 remains the deepest first-class analytics playbook. Lack of a dedicated vendor
file never permits schema inference.

## Authority

Use the approved tracking plan or exact direct analytics decision for business meaning, event,
fields, literals, source mappings, filters, and success timing. Use current official destination
documentation and the installed GTM template for technical validity and field implementation.

Do not translate a GA4 event or ecommerce payload by analogy. A similarly named event in Adobe,
Matomo, Piwik PRO, Piano, Amplitude, Mixpanel, or another product is a separate destination contract.

## Research and template gate

Before design:

1. open the vendor's current official browser collection documentation;
2. identify product/edition, site/property identity, library or endpoint, event method, and schema;
3. inspect the exact native, official, gallery, organization-owned, or custom template;
4. establish template permissions, code/version, automatic behavior, and available fields;
5. confirm source types, arrays, null behavior, limits, reserved names, identity fields, and consent;
6. record property-side administration separately.

Block the affected requirement when no current primary schema or safe installed-template path can be
established. Custom HTML is not an automatic fallback for missing product knowledge.

## Design the analytics graph

Determine whether the product requires a base/configuration tag, event tags, command queue, shared
settings variable, or one event-dispatch template. Reconcile hard-coded, plugin, partner, or existing
container implementations before adding another initialization path.

Map every field through source, GTM resolution, installed-template field, and official destination
parameter. Preserve exact approved semantics and use explicit eligibility for invalid required data.
For SPAs, establish state update order, virtual page-view ownership, retained values, and duplicate
prevention from current product documentation.

## Consent and identity

Default to strict/basic CMP blocking. Use another consent route only when explicitly approved and
currently documented for the exact browser product. Keep anonymous, adaptive, cookie-control, and
no-request behavior distinct; do not call each one advanced consent.

Do not pass advertising matching data, raw PII, or another product's user identifier into an
analytics destination unless the exact approved analytics contract and current product terms permit
it. Treat property/site IDs as controlled destination inputs.

## Vendor-specific routing

Use current official entry points for the exact product. Examples include:

- Matomo browser tracking and GTM installation: https://matomo.org/faq/new-to-piwik/how-do-i-use-matomo-analytics-within-gtm-google-tag-manager/
- Matomo consent: https://developer.matomo.org/guides/tracking-consent
- Piwik PRO analytics and consent: https://help.piwik.pro/support/privacy/setting-consent-manager/
- Adobe Experience Platform/Web SDK: https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/web-sdk/home.html

Treat vendor-owned tag managers such as Adobe Tags or Matomo Tag Manager as other systems. This
skill configures their browser destination from GTM only when a current supported path exists; it
does not administer those tag managers.

## Acceptance

Read back base/event separation, destination identity, complete field set, triggers, consent,
settings, template version, automatic behavior, and all references. Report external property setup
and required runtime recette separately. `Configured` proves the saved GTM graph, not that the
vendor received or processed data.
