## Resolve the brief

Require the X Ads account/use, pixel identity, exact conversion event identity where applicable,
business action, optimization/audience objective, source event, and environment. Distinguish the
base pixel from each lower-funnel event.

## Research the current browser integration

Open the current official page at
https://business.x.com/en/help/campaign-measurement-and-analytics/conversion-tracking-for-websites
and inspect the installed X Pixel template/partner integration. Confirm current base/event fields,
supported event types, parameters, automatic/dataLayer behavior, and deprecations.

## Configure base and event tags

Reuse one compatible base pixel per identity/environment. Configure event tags from the exact
platform event identity and current template fields. Reconcile partner-created GTM objects,
hard-coded code, automatic site/landing-page events, and any “dataLayer Standard Events” option to
prevent duplicate lower-funnel events.

Do not reuse a GA4 event name as an X conversion identifier. Keep pixel and event identities
separate and block when the platform-side event has not been created or supplied.

## Ecommerce and matching

Use the current official value, currency, content collection, and conversion/deduplication fields.
Require the exact catalog convention, preserve all eligible items, and fail closed on missing
required identifiers. Load the transformation playbook for array projection.

User parameters or matching require explicit approval, accepted fields, normalization/hash
ownership, consent, and destination isolation. Event or conversion IDs are not generated merely
because a future server-side implementation might use them.

Default strict/basic CMP blocking and establish current X-specific consent behavior before any
other route.

## Verify

Read back base/event tags, pixel and event identities, template/version, fields, item shape,
triggers, consent, matching, automatic behavior, folder, and references. Keep Events Manager setup,
audiences, catalog, Test Events/Pixel Helper, runtime receipt, and publication external.
